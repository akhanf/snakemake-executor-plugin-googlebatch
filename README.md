# Snakemake Executor Google Batch

> This is currently a skeleton and not ready for use, but come back soon! üéÉÔ∏è

This is the [Google Batch](https://cloud.google.com/batch/docs/get-started) external executor plugin for snakemake.
If you are migrating from Google Life Sciences see [this documentation](https://cloud.google.com/batch/docs/migrate-to-batch-from-cloud-life-sciences). For the underlying Python SDK, see [google-cloud-batch](https://github.com/googleapis/google-cloud-python/tree/main/packages/google-cloud-batch) on GitHub.


## Usage

### Setup

You'll likely want to start by setting up [application default credentials](https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/provide-credentials-adc#how-to)
The easiest thing to do is run:

```bash
gcloud auth application-default login
```

### Quick Start

The basic usage is, from a directory with your Snakefile, to ask for `googlebatch` as the
executor.

```bash
$ snakemake --jobs 1 --executor googlebatch
```

You are minimally required to provide a project and region, and can do this through the environment or command line:

```bash
export SNAKEMAKE_GOOGLEBATCH_PROJECT=myproject
export SNAKEMAKE_GOOGLEBATCH_REGION=us-central1
snakemake --jobs 1 --executor googlebatch
```

or

```bash
export SNAKEMAKE_GOOGLEBATCH_PROJECT=myproject
export SNAKEMAKE_GOOGLEBATCH_REGION=us-central1
snakemake --jobs 1 --executor googlebatch --googlebatch-project myproject --googlebatch-region us-central1
```

### Arguments

And custom arguments can be any of the following, either on the command line or provided in the environment.

| Name | Description | Flag | Type | Environment Variable | Required | Default |
|------|-------------|------|------|----------------------|----------|---------|
| project | The name of the Google Project | `--googlebatch-project` | str | `SNAKEMAKE_GOOGLEBATCH_PROJECT` | True |  unset |
| region | The name of the Google Project region (e.g., us-central1) | str | `--googlebatch-region` |`SNAKEMAKE_GOOGLEBATCH_REGION` | True | unset |
| machine_type | Google Cloud machine type or VM (mpitune configurations are on c2 and c2d family) | str | `--googlebatch-machine-type` | | False | c2-standard-4 |
| image_family | Google Cloud image family (defaults to hpc-centos-7) | str | `--googlebatch-image-family` | | False | hpc-centos-7 |
| image_project | The project the selected image belongs to (defaults to cloud-hpc-image-public) | str |  `--googlebatch-image-project` | | False | cloud-hpc-image-public |
| bucket | A bucket to mount with snakemake data | str | `--googlebatch-bucket` | | False |  unset |
| mount_path | The mount path for a bucket (if provided) | str | `--googlebatch-mount-path` | | False | /mnt/share |
| work_tasks | The default number of work tasks (these are NOT MPI ranks) | int | `--googlebatch-work-tasks` | | False | 1 |
| cpu_milli | Milliseconds per cpu-second | int| `--googlebatch-cpu-milli` | | False | 1000 |
| work_tasks_per_node | The default number of work tasks per node (Google Batch calls these tasks) | int | `--googlebatch-work-tasks-per-node` | | False | 1 |
| memory | Memory in MiB | int | `--googlebatch-memory` | | False | 1000 |
| retry_count | Retry count (default to 1) | int | `--googlebatch-retry-count` | | False | 1 |
| max_run_duration | Maximum run duration, string (e.g., 3600s) | str | `--googlebatch-max-run-duration` | | False | "3600s" |
| labels | Comma separated key value pairs to label job (e.g., model=a3,stage=test) | str | `--googlebatch-labels` | | False | unset|
For machine type, note that for MPI workloads, mpitune configurations are validated on c2 and c2d instances only.
Also note that you can customize the machine type on the level of the step (see [Step Options](#step-options) below).

### Additional Environment Variables

The following environment variables are available within any Google batch run:

 - `BATCH_TASK_INDEX`: The index of the workflow step (Google Batch calls a "task")

### Step Options

The following options are allowed for batch steps. This predominantly includes most arguments.

#### googlebatch_machine_type

This will define the machine type for a particular step, overriding the default from the command line.

### Questions

- What leads to STATE_UNSPECIFIED?
- Should MPI barriers / install be integrated into wrappers or here?
- How do we represent more than one runnable in a step?
- How do we install Snakemake without a container?

### Tutorial

For this tutorial, we will start int he Example directory.

```bash
$ cd ./example

# This says "use the custom executor module named snakemake_executor_plugin_googlebatch"
$ snakemake --jobs 1 --executor googlebatch
```

plugin for use or development (that doesn't need to be added to upstream snakemake).
